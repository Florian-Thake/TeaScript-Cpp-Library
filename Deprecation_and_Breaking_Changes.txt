TeaScript Breaking Changes in the actual release
=================================================

    Changes in TeaScript language
    ------------------------------------
    Function parameters without assign specifier are shared assign by default now.
    Furthermore, explicit shared function parameters without 'const' or 'def' specifier are set
    implicit to 'auto' now. They will be either 'const' or 'def' depending on the rhs argument/passed parameter.
    
    This behavior is experimental but activated by default. You can switch it of by
    - define TEASCRIPT_DEFAULT_SHARED_PARAMETERS and/or TEASCRIPT_DEFAULT_SHARED_AUTO_PARAMETERS to false. (see Dialect.hpp)
    - set parameters_are_default_shared and/or shared_parameters_are_default_auto in the relevant Dialect class instance. (see Dialect.hpp)
    - for TeaScript Host App use --old-deepcopy-parameters (this option will be removed in the future)
    
    Quick examples:
    func test( a ) {}          will result in: func test( const a @= ) {}     //NEW
    func test( const a ) {}    will result in: func test( const a @= ) {}     //NEW
    func test( def a ) {}      will result in: func test( def a @= ) {}       //NEW
    func test( a := ) {}       will result in: func test( const a := ) {}
    // important:
    func test( a @= ) {}       will result in: func test( auto a @= ) {}      //NEW
    //note: auto is not a keyword yet!
    
    With this e.g., the stack utility function func stack_push( stack @=, val @= ) { /**/ } can handle const and mutable values
    correctly. values which are const can be passed and keep the constness. mutable values can still be passed and keep the 
    mutability as well.
    

    Changes in CoreLibrary functionality
    ------------------------------------
    clock_utc() has a breaking change on Windows and Linux with gcc >= 13.
    clock_utc() now returns always the UTC time in system clock representation.
    On Windows and on Linux with GCC >= 13 this is a breaking change since the leap seconds are not counted anymore.
    The previous wrong behavior resulted due to a misunderstanding of the underlying C++ API.
    Now there isn't an annoying offset to the system clock time anymore.

    strtrim() first parameter was a const @= by accident. changed to correct def @=.
    Now the function will not take a const string as input parameter anymore!
    This worked because of a const correct bug, which has been fixed now (see C++ API level breaking changes below).


    Changes on C++ API level
    ------------------------------------
    T & ValueObject::GetValue() was not const correct for the case the inner value was const.
    In that case also a non const reference was returned and the const value could be modified. This has been fixed now.
    
    GetValue() from a non const value object is invoked but which has a const inner value will throw a exception::bad_value_cast now.
    This can result in unexpected exceptions in old code!
    
    To fix this, you can call GetValue< Type const >() instead.
    A more clean variant would be to replace all GetValue() calls by one of GetConstValue()|GetMutableValue() or GetValueCopy().
    
    For temporarily restore the old but wrong behavior define this macro TEASCRIPT_DISABLE_GETVALUE_CONSTCHECK.
    This switch will be removed in the next release!
    
    
    tuple::foreach_element/foreach_named_element are working now with either a const ValueObject or a mutable one.
    If the functor takes mutable objects all nested const objects (if any) will be skipped.
    This is a breaking change but the old behavior was faulty as it allowed to access const elements as mutable reference.


    Visibility of Core Library functions
    ------------------------------------
    The following Core Library functions moved up to Level CoreReduced:
    
    The following Core Library functions moved up to Level Core:
    
    The following Core Library functions moved up to Level Util:
    
    The following Core Library functions moved up to Level Full:


TeaScript list of deprecated parts
=================================================

    The following deprecated parts have been finally removed from this release:
    
    --old-mutable-parameters command line option has been finnaly removed.
    For the case you want use a legacy dialect of TeaScript with default mutable parameters you need
    to change the used Dialect instance, see Dialect.hpp    


    The following parts are now deprecated and will be removed in some future release:
    
    class LibraryFunction0<> to LibraryFunction5<> are deprecated now.
    Please, use the new and generic one fits for all LibraryFunction<> instead.
