TeaScript Breaking Changes in the actual release
=================================================

    Changes in CoreLibrary functionality
    ------------------------------------
    clock_utc() has a breaking change on Windows and Linux with gcc >= 13.
    clock_utc() now returns always the UTC time in system clock representation.
    On Windows and on Linux with GCC >= 13 this is a breaking change since the leap seconds are not counted anymore.
    The previous wrong behavior resulted due to a misunderstanding of the underlying C++ API.
    Now there isn't an annoying offset to the system clock time anymore.
