CHANGELOG OF TEASCRIPT
=======================
This changelog is for the TasScript Host Application as well as the TeaScript C++ Library.

NOTE: The dates are not the release dates, but a last commit date.


================
VERSION 0.17.0 (not released yet, pre-release)
================
    CLEAN: removed TEASCRIPT_DISABLE_GETVALUE_CONSTCHECK switch.
    - Please, call GetValue< Type const >() for inner const values
      or use one of the more clean GetConstValue()|GetMutableValue() or GetValueCopy() instead.

    HOST: changed copyright year to 2026


================
VERSION 0.16.0, Sa Dec 20 12:24:43 2025
================
    VERSION: 0.16.0 - Error type, catch statement, default shared params, BSON.

    EXAMPLES: added example_v0.16.tea for demo catch, Error and bson.
    - added bson test to corelibrary_test05.tea
    COLLECTION: fixed typo in RemoveValueByKeyWithPlaceholder().
    ARITHMETIC: (optimized) don't check for overflow if types are same in Convert function.

    CORELIB: raised API level to 1 (because changed to Error return).
    CORELIB: made _f64toi64 DEPRECATED!
    - removed all internal usage of _f64toi64.

    CORELIB (BREAKING!): changed all _buf_get_x functions to return Error instead of Bool(false).    
    CORELIB (BREAKING!): clean and proper Error handling for more functions which
    ... returned Bool(false) on error but has a different type as Bool on success.
    ... They will now return the new Error type on error.
    - changed functions: _strfromascii, read[text]file, read[toml|json]file,
      read[toml|json]string, write[toml|json]string, read/writebsonbuffer

    CORELIB (BREAKING!): _strtonum/_strtonumex now return an Error instead of a Bool(false)
    CORELIB (BREAKING!): changed to_i64/to_f64 return an Error instead of Bool(false).
    - improved to_number() for Number input (and Error input)

    TSVM: added TSVM instruction Catch for execute Error path if Error/NaV is on top stack.
    TSVM: added TSVM instruction Swap for swapping top and top-1
    FIXED: (in TSVM) stack cleanup for some early return cases, e.g. def x := 10 + return 123
    ... needed for def n := foo() catch return -1  /  def m := baz() catch( err ) { return err }
    FIXED: (in TSVM) broken stack after debug operator.

    CORELIB: added _error_[get_code/get_name/get_message], make_runtime_error
    TEST: added corelibrary_test06.tea and v0.16 test in test01
    TEASCRIPT: as operator: added cast from NaV to Error, don't cast if type is same already
    - as operator: Error cannot be casted and stays as Error.
    MISC: Added syntaxhighlighting for catch and Error.

    TEASCRIPT: added catch statement for easy error handling similar as in Zig.
    - examples (assuming _strtonum returns an Error on error):
      def number := _strtonum( "abc" ) catch 2 // on error number is 2
      def number := _strtonum( "abc" ) catch( err ) return err // on error early return with err

    TEASCRIPT: Introduced distinct Error type for a clean error handling.
    - Errors consist of an error code and a message.
    - Errors can be created via make_runtime_error(s) or simply cast a String into Error.
    - Errors can be concatenated to strings and in boolean contexts they evaluate to false.
    - For the time being all Error related classes and functions are considered EXPERIMENTAL.
    PROJ: split class TypeInfo and TypePtr into new TypeIinfo.hpp.

    HOST: added :inspect function command printing AST or TSVM instruction of a function.

    BUILD: Support VS 17.14 by targeting latest installed WinSDK
    BUILD: Support Visual Studio 2022 17.13 with C++23 preview.
    FIX: C++23 - Printing without libfmt. Use std::print again instead of std::vprint_unicode.
    ... On Linux it just works, 
    ... on Windows with VS 17.13 at least in Windows Terminal (but not in old conhost.exe).

    3RDPARTY|HOST: updated to fmt 11.1.4, hard minimum is still 10.1.1

    CORELIB|JSON: added experimental BSON support if nlohmann::json Adapter is used.
    - added readbsonbuffer and writebsonbuffer to core library for ...
    ... Tuple <--> BSON Buffer conversion.

    HOST: added ascii/uttf-8 art logo to welcome screen of interactive shell.
    - can be suppressed with --no-logo
    - fixed default eval mode for some implicit interactive shell launches, e.g., -i or --silent.

    CLEAN: finally removed deprecated CoreLibrary::ExitScript().
    - Please, use _Exit val instead or directly throw teascript::control::Exit_Script from C++.

    UTIL: made tuple::foreach_element/foreach_named_element working with const and ...
    - ... mutable ValueObjects. If inner elements change to const and the provided 
      functor takes a const ValueObject it will be called, otherwise nested const
      elements will be skipped. This is a BREAKING change!

    STACKVM: Fixed instruction UndefElement was able to modify const tuples.
    CORELIB: Fixed _strreplacepos() was able to modify const strings.
    - This affected other functions taking a non const reference as well.
    - strtrim() now takes a correct def @= as parameter instead of const @=.
    VALUEOBJ: T& GetValue() is const correct now for the case the inner value is const.
    - For the case a non const reference is requested and the inner value is const 
      an exception::bad_value_cast is thrown now.
    - BREAKING: This can be unexpected behavior in existing code. Use GetValue< Type const >().
    - Introduced clean T const & GetConstValue(), T & GetMutableValue() and T GetValueCopy().
    CORELIB: use new and generic one fits for all LibraryFunction<> for all core library functions.
    FUNC: (DEPRECTAED!) made old LibraryFunctions0 to LibraryFunctions5 deprecated! 

    CLEAN: finally removed deprecated --old-mutable-parameters from command line parameters.
    TEASCRIPT: Function parameters without assign specifier are shared assign by default now.
    - Furthermore, explicit shared function parameters without 'const' or 'def' specifier are 
      set implicit to 'auto' now. They will be either 'const' or 'def' depending on the 
      rhs argument/passed parameter.
      Quick examples:
      func test( a ) {}          will result in: func test( const a @= ) {}     //NEW
      func test( const a ) {}    will result in: func test( const a @= ) {}     //NEW
      func test( def a ) {}      will result in: func test( def a @= ) {}       //NEW
      func test( a := ) {}       will result in: func test( const a := ) {}
      // important:
      func test( a @= ) {}       will result in: func test( auto a @= ) {}      //NEW
      //note: auto is not a keyword yet!

      With this e.g., the stack utility function func stack_push( stack @=, val @= ) { /**/ } 
      can handle const and mutable values correctly. values which are const can be passed and 
      keep the constness. mutable values can still be passed and keep the mutability as well.

    CORELIB: clock_utc() now returns always the UTC time in system clock representation.
    - this is a breaking change on Windows and Linux with gcc >= 13.
      The leap seconds are not counted anymore. Thus, the annoying offset to the system time is gone.
    ASTNODE: as operator - optimized the ifs to a switch.
    HOST: changed copyright year to 2025


================
VERSION 0.15.1, Sun Nov 03 13:25:32 2024
================
    VERSION: 0.15.1 - fixed header only compile for Engine and CoroutineScriptEngine.


================
VERSION 0.15.0, Thu Aug 29 13:00:21 2024
================
    VERSION: 0.15.0 - Web Server / Web Client module preview, JSON read/write, TOML write.

    DEMO: added web preview demo to demo project.
    DOCU: updated docu, readmes, comments and other texts.
    HOST: added pretty_print error for :compile|:exec|:continue.

    FUNC: introduced new and improved, one fits all, LibraryFunction.    
    - the new incarnation will replace the old LibraryFunction0 ... LibraryFunction5.
    - the new incarnation can handle arbitrary parameter amount as well as
      supports an optional Context as the first parameter for all cases.
    - the new incarnation is only used in the WebPreview module for now.
    - tested WebPreview + LibraryFunction on Linux.

    WEB: added optional time measurement for debugging (compile time switch), ...    
    - web_client.tea: default to 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost
      to reduce chance of slow connection establishing.

    WEB: added Web preview module with web_get(), web_post(), web_server_setup(), ...    
    ... web_server_accept(), web_server_reply(), web_server_build_reply(),
        web_set_payload(), web_add_header() and web_build_request()
    - this is the first Module based on (experimental) IModule interface.
    - web preview must be enabled manually for the default Engine and cannot
      be loaded on demand from the script (yet). If enabled, it will be always
      loaded into the context.
    - web preview has build-in support for json as payload. Any Content-Type
      of "application/json" will be automatically transformed into a Tuple
      structure representing the Json object.
    - Tuples can be automatically send as a json string in web clients and
      web server messages.
    - added web_client.tea and web_server.tea as examples.
    - splitted LibraryFunctions out of CoreLibrary into own header.
    - moved utf8_path()/utf8_path_to_str() to UtilInternal.hpp

    JSON: fixes for g++ and clang.
    JSON: added Boost.Json as well as RapidJSON Adapter.

    TEST: added corelibrary_test05 with JSON and extended TOML test.    
    - extended corelibrary_test01 and corelibrary_test03 with new functions.
    VALUEOBJ: explicitly handling NaV in threeway comparison operator.    
    - need to distinguish between set TypeInfo and current(!) InternalType

    JSON: implemented write support for nlohmann::json Adapter.    
    - added GetAdapterName() to JsonSupport.
    - added features.json_adapter string variable
    - changed features.json to reflect the TEASCRIPT_JSONSUPPPRT value.

    JSON: implemented writejsonstring|writejsonfile, implemented ...    
    - ... JsonToValueObject()/JsonFromValueObject() on C++ level
      The Json objects will be of the type of the unerlying Json library in use.
    - added threeway comparison for ValueObject with Buffer type.

    TOML|JSON: toml|json_make_array accept aribtrary params like _tuple_create    
    - added _tuple_named_create for easy creating dictionaries.
      this function accepts Tuples with size 2 and first element with String (Key)
      as parameters, e.g.: _tuple_named_create( ("name", "John"), ("age", 31) )
    - added toml_make_table and json_make_object based on _tuple_named_create
    - added toml_table_size and toml_array_size
    - added json_object_size and json_array_size

    JSON|TOML: streamlined array support, added bunch of utility functions...    
    - added toml_is_array, toml_array_empty, toml_array_append,
      toml_array_insert, toml_array_remove, toml_make_array, toml_is_table
    - added json_is_array, json_array_empty, json_array_append,
      json_array_insert, json_array_remove, json_make_array, json_is_object
    - added readjsonfile

    JSON: allow all possible json values as root value.  
    - therefore false cannot be returned as an error as well as NaV cannot.
    - return TypeNaV instead to indicate an error until a real Error type exists.
    - JSON/TOML: It cannot be distinguished whether an empty Tuple is an empty array
      or an empty object/table. In order to do this an empty array is marked via an
      empty Buffer as value. A Buffer is neither a valid value in Toml nor in Json,
      so it can be used safely as a marker.
    - TOML: distinguish whether an empty Tuple is an empy array or an empty table when
      write a Toml string.
    - JSON/TOML: correctly handle empty string keys.

    TEASCRIPT: added built in JSON read support with Pico Json.
    - added Pico Json header only lib to teascript/thirdparty/
    - added JsonAdapterPico for adapt Pico Json to Tuple
    - added JsonSupport and be prepared to use a different adapter,
      e.g. for nlohmann, rapid or boost json.

    CORELIB: added Toml write support (writetomlfile, writetomlstring)
    - added TomlToTuple()/TupleToToml() for convert Tuple <--> toml::table on C++ level.
    - added IsEmpty() to Collection
    CLEAN: removed deprecated exit code and exit(), streamlined ...
    - ... left over Exit_Script handling.
    - CoreLibrary::ExitScript() will remain one more version before removal.
    3RDPARTY: updated to fmt 11.0.2, set a hard minimum of 10.1.1


================
VERSION 0.14.0, Wed May 08 17:41:05 2024
================
    VERSION: 0.14.0 - TeaStackVM, Compiler, (Dis)Assembler, Suspend + Continue, Yield, improved debugging.

    DIST: Syntax highlighting for dark mode notepad++
    DIST: removed mentioning libfmt 9.1.0, it must be 10.1.1 or newer.
    DIST: updated instructions.txt
    DIST: updated Deprecated_ and KnownIssues.txt
    DOCU: added comments to class Constraints.
    ENGINE: added CallFunc/CallFuncEx for a handy way to call TeaScript functions.
    STACKVM: fixed instr. MakeTuple with payload 0 (issuable only via ASM)
    EXAMPLE: added example_0.14.tea for try debugging.
    HOST: added possibility to print a range of instructions only via :disasm start,end

    TEASCRIPT: removed EXPERIMENTAL state from ...
    - Const concept for checking constness of a variable.
    - class ASTNode_FilePart
    - PassthroughData interfaces and usage.
    - Get[Final]PartialParsedASTNodes of class Parser.

    LINUX: fixed compile with g++11 and clang 14.
    STACKVM: added initial reserved size for the call stack.
    CORO: protect RunFor()/ChangeCoroutine() for called more than once the same time!
    BUILD: opt-out for libfmt header only.
    ENGINE: refactored class to be used as not header only!
    - This breaks the mParser member is now only available via mBuildTools->
    - added ContextFactory class for prepare a Context via arbitrary code.
    - added more comments.
    CORO: added SetInpuParameters, Reset and Suspend. bg task and co-op demo.
    PARSER: fixed yield and calling function.
    TEASCRIPT: New form of passing arguments to script via ...
    - ... a Tuple "args" with all arguments as elements. argN still indicates amount.
    - HOST: legacy args available via --legacy-args.
    - ENGINE: legacy args available via TEASCRIPT_ENGINE_USE_LEGACY_ARGS=1
    - EXAMPLES: handle new and legacy form of arguments.
    FIX: Stack too small if suspend/yield was last stmt of loop
    ENGINE: improved comments.
    CORO: Implemented first version of CoroutineScriptEngine!
    - LIB: added opt-out for header only usage. User can pick one TU which must set
      TEASCRIPT_INCLUDE_DEFINITIONS to 1 and TEASCRIPT_DISABLE_HEADER_ONLY to 1
      and include CoroutineScriptEngine.hpp there (Engine.hpp will follow).
      All other TUs with teascript includes must set TEASCRIPT_DISABLE_HEADER_ONLY to 1.
    - DEMO: changed project to opt-out header only for demonstration.
      This saves a lot of includes, esp. CoreLibrary, Parser, StackMachine and ASTNode.
    - PROJ: distinct ConfigEnums.hpp for eOptimize and config::eConfig.
    BUILD: get rid of _SILENCE_CXX20_U8PATH_DEPRECATION_WARNING as well.
    BUILD: dont need _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS for MSVC.
    DEMO: added thread suspend demo.
    DEMO: added test_code10() which will explicit compile and execute code with class Engine.
    TEST: changed corelibrary to compile for StackVM test (except basic).
    HOST: added dumping variables/functions of all present scopes intead only ...
    - ... the global one. With this all variables/functions of a suspended
      or halted program can be inspected with :ls vars or :search
    - HOST: added :dbinfo <n> where n is the instruction index for which
      the debug shall be obtained for.
    TEST: added release_test and extended_test script.
    TEST: added some basic, a mixed call + adopted Tuple Subscript tests.
    STACKVM|HOST: improved current index handling and showing debug info.
    HOST: fixed line numbers are off by one when use :parse <n>
    STACKVM: added exception handling and injection of source location for ...
    - ... all exceptions thrown actively by TeaScript during evaluation.
    - COMPILER: added distinct compile_error exception.
    - COMPILER: carry over more SourceLocations to instructions and fixed some.
    - STACKVM: finding correct source location of the caller for too less and
      too many arguments for a function call.
    CLEAN: removed deprecated ApplyUnOp|ApplyBinOp
    DIST: updated Known_Issues.txt
    SHELL: added :callstack (showing callstack) and :pc (showing current instruction)
    HOST|SHELL: updated help messages.
    STACKVM: added FunctionPtr to CallStackEntry (makes parameter info available).
    HOST: added a few ways for implicit launch interactve shell (e.g., --no-eval).
    HOST: implemented showing best matching debug info of current program position.
    - this only works if program is suspended or halted.
    - COMPILER: filling most useful debug infos in Debug mode.
    - PROGRAM: Query debug info and best matching debug info for a position.
    STACKVM: implemented constant evaluation for unary and most binary operators ...
    - ... for optimization >= O1. logical binary ops are missing as well as is/as.
    STACKVM: implemented scope optimization for O2. Removes unnecessary scopes, except ...
    - ... for early returns or loop related jumps (this still has to be done later.)
    - This gives a great speedup for e.g., fib.tea, since variable searches are one
      of the biggest performance bottlenecks actually. Each removed scope during
      a (recursive) function call chain will reduce the time until the script finishes.
    STACKVM: added timed and instruction count based constraint for exec.
    - with this the script can be suspended at any amount of executed
      instructions (one will be single step debugging).
    - ... or after any amount of passed time
      (currently in milliseconds with granularity of 10 instructions).
    STACKVM: implemented yield instruction, now scripts can yield values lika a coroutine!
    - AST: added ASTNode_Yield_Statement for have a layer from Parser to Compiler.
    - SHELL: print yielded values of suspended scripts.
    TEASCRIPT: added possibility to program in TeaScript Assembler directly for TSVM.
    - PARSER: added ##tsvm_mode and ##tsvm INSTR CONSTANT for parse TeaScript asm code.
    - ASTNODE: added ASTNode_TSVM for have a AstNode layer between Parser and Compiler.
    - COMPILER: added handling for ASTNode_TSVM which directly contains the instruction.
    HOST: added print TSVM instructions for .tsb files, added --info for ...
    - ... print the header infos (compiler version, optimization level, name)
      of a TeaScript binary file (.tsb)
    - STACKVM: load header of program does not read the whole file content anymore.
    STACKVM: implemented Save and Load of StackVM Programs (TeaScript Binary (.tsb))
    - HOST: added --compile for compile+save a <file>.tea as <file>.tea.tsb
    - HOST: added executing of .tsb files.
    FIX: reject utf8 string if first char is a follow char.
    ENGINE: added ExecuteProgram(), CompileScript|Content|Code, streamlined ...
    - ... read script file a little by using CoreLibrary::ReadTextFile[Ex] and
      util::utf8_path_to_str()
    - CORELIB: added ReadTextFileEx/WriteTextFileEx with std::filesystem::path.
    - added util::utf8_path_to_str, needed on windows to convert filesystem::path
      back to utf8 string instead of code page string.
    VALUE: made FunctionPtr and IntegerSequence first class citizen, ...
    - ... avoid usage of GetValuePtr() in favor of InternalType() and GetTypeInfo()
    - made ValueObject with Buffer always a shared one.
    - fixed constructor with FunctionPtr for the case it shall not be shared.
    ENGINE: using TeaStackVM now for execute scripts, changeble during ...
    ... construction to Eval mode, which will still evaluate the AST.
    - added script args can be passed as real ValueObjects instead of strings only.
    HOST: use MoveResult() from StackMachine.
    STACKVM: implemented subroutine execution. This enables to enter the ...
    - ... compiled land from the eval world. Not only from the interactive
      shell but also from, e.g., eval( "compiled_func()" ) it is possible
      now to execute code of compiled TeaScript functions from any eval point.
    - implemented ParamCount() and ParameterInfoStr() in CompiledFunc.
    - had to introduce CompiledFuncBase as well as CompiledFuncFactory
      in order to resolve mutual dependency between CompiledFunc and StackMachine.
    - VALUE: slightly optimized move operations.
    STACKVM: added subprogram/module like feature. A CompiledFunc may come from ...
    - ... any program. Each callstack entry saves its program source as well.
    - The program can be switched for every function call and back for every Ret.
    - This enables to use a compiled CoreLibrary (and more) in (compiled) scripts.
    - CORELIB: Bootstrap now compiles the core library (default), can be switched to eval.
    - HOST: use compiled core library for Exec, and ast eval for Shell.
    - HOST: added --no-eval for optionally use compiled core library in interactive shell.
    - HOST: added --shell for explicit launch interactive shell together with other parameters.
    - HOST: cleanup: use Config (parsed parameters) also in interactive shell, removed bools.
    - STACKVM: fixed nested loops with same lables! :-O
    - STACKVM: handle control::Exit_Script from function calls.
    HOST: added :debug ast|tsvm and separated it from :debug, updated help message.
    STACKVM: added Debug as NoOp in debug mode (debugging only)
    DIST: added suspend + yield keywords to syntax highligthing.
    STACKVM: added SubscriptGet/Set, fixed nested dot ops, fixed CallFunc with 0 params.
    STACKVM: added SetElement, DefElement, ConstElement, IsDefElement
    ... for manipulate Tuple elements.
    STACKVM: added DotOp and Undef(Tuple)Element.
    STACKVM: added and implemented MakeTuple instruction.
    LINUX: full support of gcc 13 (no limitations left).
    TEASCRIPT: added suspend and continue of scripts!
    - added suspend keyword, ASTNode_Suspend_Statement + Suspend instruction.
    - STACKVM: Suspend instruction will enter Suspended state of TeaStackVM.
    - in eval mode suspend is not supported and will just throw.
    - HOST: will auto continue suspended scripts if not launched with --interactive / -i,
      otherwise the first reached suspend will launch interactive mode.
    - SHELL: added :compile for compile a parsed script.
    - SHELL: old :exec is :eval now (evaluates parsed ast).
    - SHELL: new :exec will execute compiled script in TeaStackVM.
    - SHELL: added :continue for continue a suspended script.
    - SHELL: added :disasm for print TeaStackVM instructions of the script.
    - HOST: refactored host to use PartialParseState when entering --interactive.
    TEASCRIPT: added _Exit statement, Exit ASTNode and ExitProgram StackVM instruction.
    - made ExitScript() and exit() deprecated, _exit accepts now any value.
    - needed a distinct Exit ASTNode for easily create a compiled ExitProgram instruction.
      (detect every _exit call and replace it is too dirty.)
    - ExitProgram will exit the program from any point with scope cleanup.
    - _Exit accepts any value. A script always has a result.
      A separated exit code will not exist anymore.
    STACKVM: added return statement (also from toplevel 'main') + Unittest
    STACKVM: added default parameters for function definitions.
    - If a parameter is on the stack it will be used and jumped over the default code.
      Otherwise the default code will be executed.
    - nested default parameters are possible, e.g. when using a lambda with default params
      as default param:
      func calc( a, b := func ( x := 1 ) { x * x } ) { a + b(a) + b() }
    - added Unittest for function definitions and default parameters for StackVM.
    STACKVM: added function definition with ParamSpec and FromParam, ...
    - ... added ParamSpecClean and Ret instructions.
    - added (not implemented yet) FromParam_Or instr.
    - added CompiledFunc which actually just stores the jump address.
    - Compiled TeaScript functions are actually working without frames,
      they are just jumps and jump backs (ret).
    - using a separate 'callstack' for save the return addresses (and function name).
    TEST: added StackMachine Func Call Unittest.
    STACKVM: added if with scoped conditions and implemented correct handling ...
    - ... of comma operator (Expressions with more than one element) in if conditions.
    - added StackVM Unittest for if conditions with scope, e.g. if( def a := 10, a > 9 ) { a }
    STACKVM: slightly optimize by replacing consecutive Replace with NoOp
    TEST: added basic, if and loop stack machine tests.
    STACKVM: added forall loop (with help of ForallHead and ForallNext instr.)
    - forall loop has full support for 'stop', 'loop' and lables.
    - forall loop is more special than expected. It needs 2 entries on the stack
      for the idx variable and the IntegerSequence. This actually requires
      special stack cleanup for a result can be carried over to the caller
      without let the stack in dirty state.
      loop and stop statements must respect this as well.
    STACKVM: added Repeat loop w. loop/stop "label" (incl. scope cleanup), ...
    - ... detecting wrong labeled (not matching) stop/loop and produce a compile error.
    - a 'stop' outside of a loop is a HALT (mimic intended behavior of old scripts)
      (but with statement behavior is unspecified in such cases, means:
      don't carry a result with a top-level stop! use return)
    - a 'loop' outside of a loop is a compile error.
    HOST: added --printTSVM mode for print compiled instructions, ...
    - ... added -O0, -O1, -O2 option for specify compiler optimization mode.
      (debug mode for compiler will be also set with --debug)
    STACKVM: Instruction ToString/FromString, added threshold to DumpInstrTimes().
    STACKVM: added compiler version to program.
    STACKVM: introduced Replace for combine Pop+Push, introduced ...
    - ... TestAndJumpRel_If[Not] for combine Test and JumpRel_If[Not]
    - slightly optimized Push/Pop combinations.
    STACKVM: optimized by using in-place operations for the stack.
    - means that instead of pop + push there is a stack[s-1] = val.
    STACKVM: removed exceptions from main loop, introduced mException and mError ...
    - ... which can be obtained after Exec() if in Halted state with
      ThrowPossibleErrorException() / HasError()
    - the goal is that all eval and runtime exceptions are propagated
      via this new mechanism.
    VALUEOBJ: reduced overhead of move cosntr/assign.
    STACKVM: added Test instruction setting current stack value to Bool, ...
    - ... made logical expressions and if conditions clean (Test, Pop)

    STACKVM: experimental Suspend Request support from other threads, but ...
    ... unfortunately this is not possible for clang since it does not
        support std::stop_source/std::stop_request yet.
        clang 18 has it as experimental feature, must be activated via
        -fexperimental-library
    - Stack Machine can now be configured with and without thread support
      via template< bool >
      If without thread support the used mutex is a no-op one.
    - Suspend function is only callable if thread support is enabled.
    - fixed compile for gcc / clang, removed new warnings.
    STACKVM: created StackMachine, Compiler and Program classes from prototype, ...
    - added StackVMInstructions, StackVMCompiler, StackVMProgram, StackMachine
      headers and implementations.
    - StackMachine is prepared from being suspended from a different thread!
    - actually usable via the :compile command in interactive shell
      (will be splitted to :compile and :exec)
    ASTNODE: don't create a useless std::vector for ASTNode_ParamSpec.
    VALUEOBJ: improved default constructor, fixed and improved move.
    STACKVM: prototype of calling cpp and AstNode based functions.
    - fixed Check overload for ParamList and Return
    - use default ValueObejct constructor in NoOp ASTNode.
    ASTNODE: refactored Unary_ and Binary_Operator ASTNode:

      If the wanted pos does not point at a start of an UTF-8 code point,
      the last valid start will be used.
      This is a breaking change since the length of the returned string
      is not always 1 (or 0) but between 0 and 4 now.

    - added Collection::RemoveValueByKeyWithPlaceholder(). With this ...
    - ... undefing will be super fast due to the vector stays stable ...
    - ... and the indices in the map don't need to be touched as well.
    - Also, SetValue via SharedAssign is now straight forward as it should be.
    - added npos to Collection.
    - reduced complexity of Collection::AppendKeyValue to one lookup, so that ...
    - ... BulkAdd can be made obsolete soon.
    
    - This is only one little refactoring step. More are required for ...
    - a) multithreaded contexts.
    - b) faster lookup
    - c) and eventually different scoping behavior.

    TEST: Added a huge bunch of UnitTests for the last added features...
    TEASCRIPT: added passing parameters via shared assign.
    - brilliant solution for passing parameter as shared. We specify the assignment operator explicit!
      Then, if we omit the default value/expression a dummy is added to signal that pass a parameter
      is mandatory. With this we easily have shared assign for function parameters with and without
      default value/expression.
    - also can specify optionally const to parameter definition.
    - added swap function to CoreLibrary which is now possible via shared assign.
    TEASCRIPT: added typeof and typename unary operators.

    IMPROVE: added error handling to _strtonum (return Bool(false))
    TEASCRIPT: Added TypeSystem and const variables!

    - Types are stored in TypeSystem class
    - Allow ValueObject becomes NaV without losing original Type.
    TEASCRIPT: added double as type and ArithmeticHelper functions for be able to support more types!
    TEASPCRIPT: added shared assign which will share the value between both operands.
    - share assign operator is @=
    - test if 2 variables are shared with @@
    - get (internal) share_count with @? (unary op)
    - refactored assign and def, now all is streamlined clean in assign operator.
    TEASCRIPT: added default parameter for functions and improved parameter handling
    - ParamList is now provided per Context in current scope.
    - added FromParamList[_Or] which consumes one value from current param list in scope.

    ASTNODE/PARSER: added Return Statement
    TEASCRIPT: added function def, function call and lambdas!
    - func def with func name( paramspec ) {}
    - or def name := func ( paramspec ) {}
    - the latter is also a lambda
    - added ASTNode_ParamSpec and ASTNode_ParamList, where the first creates new vars in the context,
      and the latter evals a list of statements to the parameter list.
    - added ASTNode_Func and ASTNode_CallFunc, where the first is a func definition and will create a Func Object on Eval
      and the latter will get the Func object from the context and call it.
    - added parsing of comma , for build a list of statements.
    TEASCRIPT/PARSER: added String as value type and in-string evaluation.    
    - string literals are normal used with enclosing double quotes "
    - escape sequence for tab, cr, nl, \, ", %
    - string concatenation operator is %
    - auto to string for string concat.
    - auto to number for arithmetic works as expected.
    - in-string eval is done with %(expr) (including inner strings without extra quoting!)
    UTIL: added TEASCRIPT_PRINT macro in new header Print.hpp

================
Version 0.3.0 (unreleased), Wed Jun 1 16:07:33 2022
================
    VERSION: 0.3.0 - def and undef variables, check with is_defined, assign, script arguments
    
    This milestone release contains
    - defining variables with keyword 'def'
    - undefine variables with keyword 'undef' (returns true if a variable existed and was undefined.)
    - check if a variable is defined with keyword 'is_defined'
    - assign new values to existing variables.
    - also the script can access the script arguments as global variables with arg1 ... argN
    - number of passed arguments can be queried with argN global variable.
    - with all of that a logical branching is already possible but unnatural (see example script).

    CONTENT: added [] operator for faster accessing character at offset position
    TEASCRIPT: passing command arguments to the script.
    TEASCRIPT/PARSER: added is_defined operator for variables.
    - this is valid code: is_defined a or (def a := 1)
    TEASCRIPT: define und undefine variables, assign and use them!    
    - added Context with Scopes for store, find and set values of variables.
    - ASTNode_Assign as binary operator for assign values to variables.
    - ASTNode_Var_Def_Undef for define and undefine variables (currently as unary operator).
    - Operator Precedence: deep lifting of inserted ASTNodes for complex operator and precedence combinations!
    - Unittest for variables.
    VALUE: ValueObject can now have either a shared or a unshared value!

================
Version 0.2.0 (unreleased), Tue May 24 22:22:03 2022
================
    VERSION: 0.2.0 - boolean constants, logical operators, operator precedence, mul/div, ...
    - added boolean true / false constants
    - added logical operators and, or (binary) and not (unary)
    - added real Unary_Operator ASTNode.
    - added integer mul and div.
    - operator precedence (and binds stronger as or, mul/div stronger as plus/minus)
    - added ASTNode_Identifier skeleton
    - convert to long long for arithmetic and to bool for logical operators.
    - throw division by zero when rhs is 0 for integer div.
    - Unittest for eval arithmetic and logical expressions.

================
Version 0.1.0 (unreleased), Mon May 23 16:05:03 2022
================
    VERSION: 0.1.0 - binary (+ simulated unary) Operators +/- for Integers and ...
    ... creating subexpressions with parentheses (grouping).
    ATSNODE: added IsDummy() for avoid casting + convenience IsIncomplete()
    PARSER: added (Sub-/Nested-)Expression parsing
    - added ASTNode_Expression for sub expressions.
    - added debug mode for print the AST to interactive shell (use :debug)
    TEASCRIPT/PARSER: added binary operator + and - for Integers (and simulate unary +/- as well)    
    - actually an iterative approach is chosen for parsing (instead of a recursive one).
    - ASTNode_Binary_Operator for + and - (applied to a lhs and rhs node)
    - Parser will fake an unary +/- by building a Binary Operator with a 0 as lhs value

    - added version.h with version information.
    - note: this is the first and (probably) also the last .h file (instead of .hpp)
      which can be included also in plain C source code. The Version C MACROS can be used.
      This enables a future Wrapper C API (if needed/wanted).
    PARSER: fixed more than one integer constants can occur at same line

    PARSER: added parsing_error exception with current position.
    UNITTEST: added Unittest based on Boost Test
    

================
Unreleased, first documented version (without version number), Fri Apr 29 21:41:18 2022
================    
    Initial commit of TeaScript.
    
    Includes the TeaScript command line program (the script host) which comes with an interactive shell to parse (and later eval)
    TeaScript code as well as the functionality to pass script files or a TeasScript code string via command line parameter.
    The intend is to parse and execute generic TeaScript code, either interactive or more likely by running a script file.
    The interactive shell supports multi line inputs (via backslash at end of line).
    The TeaScript engine (the parsing and eval mechanism) will be developed as an include only library.
    The engine will be designed to run inside a C++ environment and shall be able to interact with the host environment
    in both directions (from host to script (e.g. make classes, variables, functions available) and
    from script to host (e.g. get return values back to C++ code, throw catchable std exceptions, etc. )).
    The Parser recognizes already hash lines, single line comments and multi line comments and is able to handle
    whitespace and EOLs as well.
    The Content class for keep track of the parsable input content has a lot of handy operators for moving the current
    parsing position, get the content and query and calculate extra information like line and column position as well as
    remaining and processed characters information.
    The Content class can be used with strings, static string literals and also for string_views and archaic raw pointers.
    This commit also includes some handy debug_print functions as well as the skeletons for class State and ASTNode.
    Future features of the TeaScript language and its engine might be (but are not limited to):
    support functions with pre-condition and post-condition code blocks, interactive script files, parallel keyword/code blocks,
    easy network / HTTP ReST support, easy and/or advance file io and multithreading support, batch jobs,
    image/memory processing abstraction, ...
